# Custom Actions

In this section, we will cover how to create and use custom actions in GitHub Actions. We will explore JavaScript/TypeScript actions, containerized actions, composite actions, and publishing private actions for reuse.

## Writing Custom JavaScript/TypeScript Actions

Custom JavaScript/TypeScript actions allow you to write actions using JavaScript or TypeScript. These actions can be used to automate tasks in your workflows.

### Example: Custom JavaScript Action

1. Create a new directory for your action:

```sh
mkdir -p .github/actions/custom-js-action
```

2. Create an `index.js` file in the action directory:

```js
const core = require('@actions/core');

try {
  const name = core.getInput('name');
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
} catch (error) {
  core.setFailed(error.message);
}
```

3. Create an `action.yml` file in the action directory:

```yaml
name: 'Custom JavaScript Action'
description: 'A custom action written in JavaScript'
inputs:
  name:
    description: 'The name to greet'
    required: true
runs:
  using: 'node12'
  main: 'index.js'
```

4. Use the custom action in your workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  custom-js-action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run custom JavaScript action
        uses: ./.github/actions/custom-js-action
        with:
          name: 'GitHub Actions Workshop'
```

## Writing Containerized Actions

Containerized actions allow you to package your action as a Docker container. This can be useful when your action requires a specific environment or dependencies.

### Example: Containerized Action

1. Create a new directory for your action:

```sh
mkdir -p .github/actions/containerized-action
```

2. Create a `Dockerfile` in the action directory:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:12

COPY . .

RUN npm install

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "/index.js"]
```

3. Create an `index.js` file in the action directory (although we're using Node.js in this example, you can use any language or runtime that can be packaged as a Docker container):

```js
const core = require('@actions/core');

try {
  const name = core.getInput('name');
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
} catch (error) {
  core.setFailed(error.message);
}
```

4. Create an `action.yml` file in the action directory:

```yaml
name: 'Containerized Action'
description: 'A custom action packaged as a Docker container'
inputs:
  name:
    description: 'The name to greet'
    required: true
runs:
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'Dockerfile'
```

5. Use the containerized action in your workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  containerized-action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run containerized action
        uses: ./.github/actions/containerized-action
        with:
          name: 'GitHub Actions Workshop'
```

## Writing Composite Actions

Composite actions allow you to combine multiple steps into a single action. This can help simplify your workflows and make them more reusable.

### Example: Composite Action

1. Create a new directory for your action:

```sh
mkdir -p .github/actions/composite-action
```

2. Create an `action.yml` file in the action directory:

```yaml
name: 'Composite Action'
description: 'A custom composite action'
inputs:
  name:
    description: 'The name to greet'
    required: true
runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - name: Print greeting
      run: echo "Hello, ${{ inputs.name }}!"
    - name: Print current date
      run: date
```

3. Use the composite action in your workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  composite-action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run composite action
        uses: ./.github/actions/composite-action
        with:
          name: 'GitHub Actions Workshop'
```

## Publishing Private Actions for Reuse

Private actions can be published and reused within your organization. This can help you share common actions across multiple repositories. For this use case, we recommend using a monorepo to store your Action, so other users can easily find it, read its documentation, and use it in their workflows pointing to a specific version, SHA, or branch.

### Use the private action in your workflow:

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: <your_org>/<action_repo>@<sha/branch/version>
```

## Exercise: Creating and Using Custom Actions

In this exercise, you will create and use different types of custom actions in GitHub Actions. Follow the high-level instructions below to complete each task.

### Task 1: Custom JavaScript/TypeScript Action

1. Create a new directory for your custom JavaScript/TypeScript action.
2. Write a JavaScript file that performs a simple task using the GitHub Actions toolkit.
3. Define the action metadata in an `action.yml` file.
4. Use your custom action in a GitHub Actions workflow.

### Task 2: Containerized Action

1. Create a new directory for your containerized action.
2. Write a `Dockerfile` to define the environment and dependencies for your action.
3. Write a script that performs a simple task and package it in the Docker container.
4. Define the action metadata in an `action.yml` file.
5. Use your containerized action in a GitHub Actions workflow.

### Task 3: Composite Action

1. Create a new directory for your composite action.
2. Define multiple steps in an `action.yml` file to perform a series of tasks.
3. Use your composite action in a GitHub Actions workflow.

### Task 4: Publishing Private Actions

1. Create a new repository or use an existing one to store your private actions.
2. Define the action metadata and implementation in the repository.
3. Use your private action in a GitHub Actions workflow by referencing the repository and a specific version, SHA, or branch.

Complete each task by following the high-level instructions and refer to the detailed examples provided in the previous sections for guidance.
